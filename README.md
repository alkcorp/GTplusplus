## Re-use of code  
Feel free to poke about and try learn what you can from the work we've done here. I would prefer that it wasn't stolen, but if ever in doubt, please just ask Alkalus on Discord. If not for open source mods, this mod itself simply would not exist. It would probably be rare where anything would be directly copy/pasted, but please do give credit where due. Thanks & happy modding!
